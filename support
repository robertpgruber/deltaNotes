1. My notes aren’t syncing.
Make sure you’re signed into the same iCloud account on all devices and that iCloud Drive is enabled under Settings → [Your Name] → iCloud → iCloud Drive → DeltaNotes.

2. I can’t upgrade to Premium.
If your purchase didn’t complete, try restoring purchases from the Paywall or Settings screen.
Tap Restore Purchases, then sign in with the same Apple ID you used for the original purchase.
